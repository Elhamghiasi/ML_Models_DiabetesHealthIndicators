#  Diabetes Health Indicators - Classification

## Introduction

In this project, we will work with the **Diabetes Health Indicators** dataset to build machine learning models that classify the presence of diabetes. This dataset consists of 253,680 survey responses collected through the CDCâ€™s 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

We will perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to understand the data better. The dataset includes various health-related features such as:

- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Physical activity
- Smoking habits
- Alcohol consumption
- General health rating
- Diabetes diagnosis status

These indicators will help us predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes.

The target variable, `Diabetes_binary`, is a **binary classification** label:
- `0` indicates **no diabetes**
- `1` indicates **prediabetes or diabetes**

There are a total of **21 feature variables** in this dataset.
